# Fakes for reuse across multiple test-suites

This folder contains files for declaration and definition of fakes that are used by several test cases.

The implementation is based on the following description:
[How do I reuse a fake across multiple test-suites?](./../fff/README.md/#how-do-i-reuse-a-fake-across-multiple-test-suites).
