** \mainpage    %CANpie FD Documentation

%CANpie FD (CAN Programming Interface Environment) is an open source project 
and pursues the objective of creating and establishing an open and 
standardized software API for access to the CAN bus. 

The current version of the \ref page.api covers both classic CAN frames as 
well as ISO CAN FD frames. The API is designed for embedded control 
applications as well as for PC interface boards: programming of an embedded 
microcontroller is done in C, a C++ API is provided for OS independent access 
to interface boards. It is not the intention of %CANpie FD to incorporate 
higher layer functionality (e.g. CANopen, J1939).

%CANpie FD provides a method to gather information about the features of 
the CAN hardware. This is especially important for an application designer, 
who wants to write the code only once.


<h2>Compatibilty</h2>

The C language API of %CANpie FD (i.e. version 3) is compatible to 
<a href="http://canpie.sourceforge.net">CANpie</a> (i.e. version 2)
with the exception that 8 functions are deprecated. Please refer to 
the section \ref page.api_deprecated for details.
 

<h2>%CANpie File structure</h2>

Refer to \ref page.file_struct for on overview. 

<h2>%CANpie configuration options</h2>

The %CANpie FD driver offers a flexible concept for adaptation to
a CAN controller. Please refer to the section \ref CP_CONF for details.
